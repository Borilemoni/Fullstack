keyword: запазена дума от Java например class, void, int...
new: creates the given object at heap (dynamic) memory
pass by reference: pass an object to a method by reference NOT COPY
pass by value: method works with a copy of the given object 
static typed: give types to variables, arguments (parameters) and method return values
    pros (плюс) of statically typed languages:
        1. Early detection of errors
        2. Clearer communication with the computer (CPU)
        3. Performance optimization
        4. Code readability
        5. Tooling support (tool = инструмент) 
this: reference to object of the given class

member modifiers:
  static: shared state across all objects

method mofidiers:
  public: the class / variable / method can be accessed from ANY other class
  private: inverted public
  protected: can be accessed by child classes
  
  static: the method belongs to the class rather than the individual instances (objects). It can be called without creating an object first. Thus cannot use the "this" keyword.

type declaration:
  void: specifies that the given function / metho will return nothing
