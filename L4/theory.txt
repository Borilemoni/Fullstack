operator: an operator does an action on two OPERANDS (values) 
variable naming convention: camelCase
machinde code: binary (0/1)
bytecode: intermediate representation of java code
platform independent (platofrm agnostic): write once run everywhere ( JVM )

javac (the compiler) compiles your .java code -> bytecode

JVM (Java Virtual Machine): takes the generated .class (file with bytecode generated by the compiler) and
translates it into machine code independent of the OS. JVM is only a protocol / specification.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment): physical implementation of the JVM, includes all the necessary libraries
and set of tools (like the compiler javac). JRE is a superset of JVM.

JDK (Java Development Kit): set of libraries and tools for developers ONLY to develop applications. 
Includes the JRE. JDK setupset of JRE.
